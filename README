Automated python script


open the terminal

"cd ~/Downloads" to enter into the directory(presuming that uproxy.py is downloaded into the "Downloads" directory)


"chmod +x uproxy.py" to make it executable

"sudo ./uproxy.py -h" for help

and "sudo ./uproxy.py -A 192.168.1.1 4112 username password"
to configure proxies with username and password -(substitute your proxyip, port, username and password in the above command)


"sudo ./uproxy.py -R" to remove proxy settings when u no longer need it

"sudo ./uproxy.py -P 192.168.1.1 4112" 
to configure proxies in system not having username and password


This is a tool to remove or add proxy settings in Ubuntu 
The default network proxy tool in Ubuntu is buggy in implementing proxy settings with username and password
thats where "uproxy.py" comes handy.
as of now uproxy.py edits/removes proxy information in 3 system files
more support shall be extended in near future 


IMPORTANT : Always use "ubproxy.py -R" to remove any previous settings before
configuring it further
